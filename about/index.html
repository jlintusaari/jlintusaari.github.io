  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Iâ€™m a doctoral candidate in the <a href="http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/">Probabilistic Machine Learning group</a> 
at <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University</a> and a freelance software developer living in Finland with my wife and 
two children.
I have a background in Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modelling. 
My dissertation (currently in pre-examination) deals with using simulator-based models in statistical 
inference.
This blog was recently established to feature some of my free-time coding and 
machine learning projects as well as my thoughts about these topics.</p>

<p>I like designing and builduing software that fulfils a need and automates routines.
Machine learning is tool for expanding the set of problems that can be automated.
Automation can mean for example just
<a href="/2018/06/building-boggle-solver/">solving a Boggle game from an image</a>, 
or inferring where a device is located based on different measurements from the surroundings, 
such as a wifi signals or the magnetic field.</p>

<p>As a freelance developer I have built for instance <a href="https://www.vitaravinne.fi">a tailored web shop</a> 
for a customer with Ruby on Rails. <!--- The new shop was required to 
have a rather specific set of features, including accounting, that needed
to be fast and simple to use so that new employees, often short term, would be able to safely use it 
with minimal training. Also the cost of hosting the shop was to be minimized. Since the launch, 
the new shop has substantially increased the sales and consequently set multiple new sales records.-->
During my PhD studies, I was a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi">ELFI</a>, a Python software comprising a set of 
machine learning methods for simulator-based inference that was recently accepted to 
<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/mloss/">JMLR MLOSS</a>. ELFI provides a convenient interface for specifying simulator-based 
inference problems with a graph, and streamlines many tasks in performing the inference, including
parallelization to a computational cluster.</p>
